The product_institution_types.json file provides a mapping between product IDs and their corresponding institution types. This mapping is used to determine which institution types are eligible for onboarding specific products.The file is environment-specific, meaning different versions may exist for different environments to accommodate variations in available products or institution types based on environment-specific configurations.
